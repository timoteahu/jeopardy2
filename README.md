Student Created Programs:

The programs that I created are everything in the templates folder (category.html, endPage.html, etc.) and app.py. The templates are all supporting classes and classes that are to be rendered and app.py is the driver class that launches all of the other programs.

Everything inside of the static folder was either an asset from a different source or a framework that I used to ease the process of creating the website.

Every other file is just used to help launch the server and put it on the internet. 



Data:

The data is in ./static/data/jeopardy.json



External Files:

Flask
Tailwindcss
Node/NPM

Map (map categories to questions)
List (list of questions within the map)

- copy the link that it runs on which is your localhost and paste that into your browser and viola
